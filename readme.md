# shitOS

Esoteric operating system

A quasi project to spend my time on when I feel like I need to do something completely useless and fun.

Under any circumstances coding practices there are not to be considered sane. Be warned.

All of those binaries are not holding to any standard. No imported code except for boot//build process. Things are suboptimal at best. No multitasking support, no interrupts, no portability.

### Esoteric elements

- networking via serial ports
- no security or abstraction whatsoever (however non-standard arch makes it unhackable probably)
- development platform with following:
	- based on swarm of actors of limited capability
	- intelligence and decision systems are used

### To do

File system for storage of byte blobs (in progress)
Init system that launches the development platform
File linking at compile time
Linking document system calls - generally, read source before compile time and read documentations of functions and add them at build time

### Change log

2018-11-15 - variable malloc, linking at build time
July-ish 2018 - first malloc extensions
January-ish 2018 - the project begun, keyboard and terminal
