# shitOS

A quasi project to spend my time on when I feel like I need to do something completely useless and fun.

Under any circumstances coding practices there are not to be considered sane. Be warned.

All of those binaries are not holding to any standard. No imported code except for boot//build process. Things are suboptimal at best. No multitasking support, no interrupts, no portability.

### To do

Port my macro system from another project
File system for storage of byte blobs
Init system that launches the development platform

### Change log

2018-11-15 - variable malloc, linking at build time
July-ish 2018 - first malloc extensions
January-ish 2018 - the project begun, keyboard and terminal
